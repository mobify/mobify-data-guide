Thanks for contributing to this repo.

A few things we want to clarify.  We want to clarify a few things on why we write
this guide:

## Conciseness over comprehensiveness

We aim to make this guide concise, relevant and updated.  As a result, if you
are including a new article, please state:

* What extra information does this article provide?
* What does this article have overlap with the existing list?
* Do you think it should supersede some of the articles in the list?

As a rough guideline - we are looking at around 5-10 articles, and 3-5 tutorials
in this list.


## Beginner friendly - read time: less than a week.

We are hoping this guide would take a non-technical data interested person only
a few days to run through the list.  We hope they would be at the level to enjoy
a data hackathon/intro to any tech company by the end of the week.


## Opinionated towards Mobify's tech stack

As mentioned in our disclaimer, this guide is meant to be part of onboarding for
Mobify, and as a result, we have a preference on our tool stack.
