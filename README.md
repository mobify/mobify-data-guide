## 🤔 Why this guide?

This is an open-source guide that is intended to gather feedback from various
people that have worked with data teams.  In Mobify, we work closely with talents
from [wide variety of backgrounds](https://github.com/mobify/developer-values#️-promote-diversity-and-collaboration).

 🔥 🤔 😎 🚀 💭 🍾 😈 ⚖ 💕 💕

We hope that by opening some of our onboarding materials, this will give you a taste
for what is our style of work, as well as helping out candidates on
[interviews](https://www.mobify.com/jobs/how-to-land-job-mobify/), or
[data hackathons](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/global-ai-hackathon-vancouver-bc-tickets-31891933632).


-----------------

## Content of this guide

This is not meant to be a comprehensive guide, but a list of selected resources
on what we think is the minimal set to bootstrap to working on data challenges.

* [Getting started](#getting-started)
* [Engineering tools 101](#engineering-tools-101)
* [Setting up your data dojo](#setting-up-your-data-dojo)
* [Team working as with Data](#team-working-with-data)


-----------------

## How much time would this takes?

What happen if I need to go to interview / hackathon tomorrow?

* Number of articles (10-15 mins each): 2
* Number of tutorials (a few hours each): 4
* Number of advance readings (10-30 mins each): 2

We recommend you at least go through the articles and take the:
* `Python + Pandas` tutorial
* setup your environment following [Setting up your data dojo](#setting-up-your-data-dojo)


-----------------

## 💭 Getting started

So you would like to work on data eh?  There are many great resources to get you
started with the path to work with data.  For us, we recommend a few of these
articles:

* [Quora's answer - How can I become a data scientist?](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-become-a-data-scientist-1)
    - Focus on path on Data scientist. Gives good overview for background / readings that would be helpful
    - A few of these articles we will dive in at following sections

* [Applying the Scientific Method to Software Engineering](https://medium.com/lightstephq/solving-research-problems-before-lunch-applying-the-scientific-method-to-software-engineering-fded26f51038)
    - This is a good article explaining the intersection between between academia and
      a real-world engineering scenario


------------------

## 🚅 Engineering tools 101

So ready to get started?  There are 3 main engineering tool we use and hope to gather
some quick intro to bootstrap any beginners.


### Python + Pandas

At Mobify, we are a python shop which makes us focus our analysis on Python + Pandas.
Below is some of our favorite tutorial to get started:

> [DataQuest/Data scientist](https://www.dataquest.io/) is a good onboarding for Python and Pandas.
- The on-boarding experience with the personalization win us over.


### SQL

SQL is used everywhere.

> The [codecademy sql course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql) is good.
- Especially encourage to explore and try different queries in their interface.


### Git

"Why do I care about git?"  That's a common question that is asked and as an engineering company,
a lot of our discussion happen on github.  Being familiar with your workflow on git will
help you in communicating with your peers.

> The [codecademy git course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) is our recommended way
  to learn git.

(advance) If you are interested - our [branching strategy](https://github.com/mobify/branching-strategy)
  is a good way to learn about real-life discipline on how we use git.



-----------------

## 🚀 Setting up your data dojo

So are you ready to get started?  One thing we found correlated to ability of interview candidates
is the ability to get comfortable with the environment that you will use during the
interview.  We try to give a few tips.

Also see [Disclaimer](#disclaimer) - that Mobfiy is a Python shop and likely to be
Python focus for our data dojo! Our tool of choice is [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/)

### Hosted version

[Data Science workbench](https://datascientistworkbench.com/) is a great way to get started.
It present you with a hosted version of the notebook.  And the onboarding was useful.

### Self setup version

(advance) If you want to setup a self-hosted version of Jupyter, you might want to check out
[this tutorial](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)


-----------------

## Product thinking as a Data Scientist

(TBD)

# Disclaimer

We are an data shop with engineering focus shop and is opinionated towards
selecting easy to get started tools that works with our well with our stack (e.g. `Python`,
 `Jupyter Notebook`) - this is a way that we found it works well for us.

We have no affilation to any of the companies mentioned in this list.
