## 🤔 Why this guide?

This is an open-source guide that is intended to gather feedback from various
people that have worked with data teams.  In Mobify, we work closely with talents
from [wide variety of backgrounds](https://github.com/mobify/developer-values#️-promote-diversity-and-collaboration).

 🔥 🤔 😎 🚀 💭 🍾 😈 ⚖ 💕 💕

We hope that by opening some of our onboarding materials, this will give you a taste
for what is our style of work, as well as helping out candidates on
[interviews](https://www.mobify.com/jobs/how-to-land-job-mobify/), or
[data hackathons](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/global-ai-hackathon-vancouver-bc-tickets-31891933632).

## Content of this guide

This is not meant to be a comprehensive guide, but a list of selected resources
on what we think is the minimal set to bootstrap to working on data challenges.

* [Getting started](#getting-started)
* [Engineering tools 101](#engineering-tools-101)
* [Setting up your data dojo](#setting-up-your-data-dojo)
* [Team working as with Data](#team-working-with-data)

## 💭 Getting started

So you would like to work on data eh?  There are many great resources to get you
started with the path to work with data.  For us, we recommend a few of these
articles:

* [Quora's answer - How can I become a data scientist?](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-become-a-data-scientist-1)
    - Focus on path on Data scientist. Gives good overview for background / readings that would be helpful
    - A few of these articles we will dive in at following sections

* [Applying the Scientific Method to Software Engineering](https://medium.com/lightstephq/solving-research-problems-before-lunch-applying-the-scientific-method-to-software-engineering-fded26f51038)
    - This is a good article explaining the intersection between between academia and
      a real-world engineering scenario
