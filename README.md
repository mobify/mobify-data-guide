# Mobify Data Guide

Welcome to Mobify's data guide!  We provide a list of readings that would be
useful to get started working with any data set.

This is an open-source guide that is intended to gather feedback from various
people that have worked with data teams.  In Mobify, we work closely with talents
from [wide variety of backgrounds](https://github.com/mobify/developer-values#️-promote-diversity-and-collaboration).

🔥 🤔 😎 🕐 🚀 💭 🍾 😈 ⚖ 💕

We hope that by opening some of our onboarding materials, this will give you a taste
for what is our style of work, as well as helping out candidates on
[interviews](https://www.mobify.com/jobs/how-to-land-job-mobify/), or
[data hackathons](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/global-ai-hackathon-vancouver-bc-tickets-31891933632).


-----------------

## 🔖 Legend

We denote each type of articles with Emoji: 📜 🏛 📚

* 📜 Articles - expect around 10-15 mins reading time
* 🏛 Tutorials - expect minimal half day exercise
* 📚 Advance Reference (optional readings) - vary in reading time


### What happens if I am preparing for an interview/hackathon tomorrow?

We recommend you at least go through the articles and take the:

* [Python + Pandas tutorial](#-engineering-tools-101)
* Setup your environment following [Setting up your data dojo](#-setting-up-your-data-dojo)
  and run some practices


-----------------

## 🕐 Content of this guide

This is meant to be a list of selected resources
on what we think is the minimal set to bootstrap to working on data challenges.

* [Getting started](#-getting-started)
* [Data Science 101](#-data-science-101)
* [Engineering tools 101](#-engineering-tools-101)
* [Setting up your data dojo](#-setting-up-your-data-dojo)
* [Team working as proud geeks - Keep open mind](#-team-working-as-proud-keep-open-mind)

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contributing guideline


-----------------

## 💭 Getting started

So you would like to work on data eh?  There are many great resources to get you
started on the path to work with data.  For us, we recommend a few of these
articles:

* [📜 Quora's answer - How can I become a data scientist?](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-become-a-data-scientist-1)
    - Focus on career path on Data scientist. Gives good overview for background/readings that would be helpful
    - A few of these articles we will dive in at following sections

* [📜 Applying the Scientific Method to Software Engineering](https://medium.com/lightstephq/solving-research-problems-before-lunch-applying-the-scientific-method-to-software-engineering-fded26f51038)
    - This is a good article explaining the intersection between academia and
      a real-world engineering scenario


------------------

## 🚀 Data Science 101

If you come from a non statistics/machine learning background, this will be a
good starting point.

* [📚 Statistics for hackers](https://github.com/croach/statistics-for-hackers/blob/master/statistics-for-hackers.ipynb) -
  have a basic list of readings about statistics knowledge required.
* [🏛 Machine Learning for hackers](http://slendermeans.org/category/will-it-python.html) - give
  good coverage of various aspects of machine learning.
* [📜 Scikit-learn estimator map](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html) - is my
  go to place for picking the right model to use.


------------------

## 🚅 Engineering tools 101

Learning to code is an important step in becoming data literate.  There are 3 main 
engineering tool we use.


### Python + Pandas

At Mobify, we are a Python shop which makes us focus our analysis on Python + Pandas.
Below is some of our favourite tutorial to get started:

* [🏛 DataQuest/Data scientist](https://www.dataquest.io/) is a good onboarding for Python and Pandas.
* (advance) [📜 Pandas with Seaborn](https://chrisalbon.com/python/pandas_with_seaborn.html) give a simple article
  on how to do various Seaborn plots for data visualization.


### SQL

SQL is used everywhere.

* The [🏛 Codecademy SQL course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql) is our favourite tutorial.

### Command line

Being comfortable with command line will help a great deal in your work.  We 
recommend taking [🏛 Codecademy command line course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)
for this.


### Git

Git solves 2 big communication challenge working as a team:

* Resolving how multiple people work on the same piece of code, on their own computer.  Foe example
  we have [📚 branching strategy](https://github.com/mobify/branching-strategy) which helps us to organize code.
* [📜 Code review](https://www.mobify.com/insights/why-code-reviews-are-integral-to-software-development/) and 
  [📜 pull request](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/using-pull-requests-as-code-reviews--cms-21959). on Github.
  For example, see a [📚 pull request on this repo](https://github.com/mobify/mobify-data-guide/pull/1).

The [🏛 Codecademy git course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) is our recommended way
  to learn git.


-----------------

## 🚀 Setting up your data dojo

So are you ready to get started?  One thing we found correlated to the ability of interview candidates
is the ability to get comfortable with the environment that you will use during the
interview.  We try to give a few tips.

Also, see [Disclaimer](#-disclaimer) - that Mobfiy is a Python shop and likely to be
Python focus for our data dojo! Our tool of choice is [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/)

### Hosted version

[📚 Data Science workbench](https://datascientistworkbench.com/) is a great way to get started.
It presents you with a hosted version of the notebook.  And the onboarding was useful.

### Local setup (Advance)

If you want to setup a self-hosted version of Jupyter, you might want to check out
[🏛 this tutorial](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)


### Getting familiar with Jupyter notebook

[📜 Short cut keys for Jupyter](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/) will make
you a Jupyter pro.


-----------------

## 😎 Team working as proud geeks - Keep open mind

As most of us being proud of diving into our problems, and present our solutions.  Over time,
we learn a few tools to align colleagues/fellow hackers with our thoughts. Here are a few:


### Focus on the right problem to work on

> If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions
― Albert Einstein

It is a surprisingly difficult skill to learn how to work on the right problem.  Here are a few tips:

* [📜 focus on problem and learn from customers](https://blog.leanstack.com/love-the-problem-not-your-solution-65cfbfb1916b)

* Whiteboarding and Canvasing is a
great way to open our mind.  More at [📜 Introducing the Deep Learning Canvas - a variation on Startup Canvas](https://medium.com/intuitionmachine/introducing-the-deep-learning-canvas-a2e80a998f11) - You can print this out or grab a whiteboard and draw this out.

* Data [📜 Design sprint](https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/) - Keeping open minded.  We also enjoy a minimal version of this [📜 The 25-Minute Design Sprint](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/the-25-minute-design-sprint/) which we find it helpful to adjust and adapt.


### Communicating the results

> I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits - Kent Beck

Writing a readable notebook and explaining the result is a great
habit.  [📜 Clean code in Jupyter notebooks](https://www.slideshare.net/katenerush/clean-code-in-jupyter-notebooks) in our go to guide
in how to create a clean notebook.


We would like to [Keep your analysis reproducible](https://simplystatistics.org/2014/06/06/the-real-reason-reproducible-research-is-important/)

> Reproducibility is important because it is the only thing that an investigator can guarantee about a study. -- Roger Peng


-----------------

## 😈 Disclaimer

We are a data shop with engineering focus shop and is opinionated towards
selecting easy to get started tools that work with our well with our stack (e.g. `Python`,
 `Jupyter Notebook`) - this is a way that we found it works well for us.

We have no affiliation to any of the companies mentioned in this list.
